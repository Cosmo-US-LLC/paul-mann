    question: "What is DogevsPepe?",
    answer: `DogevsPepe is a crypto presale with a twist. It’s a competition between two iconic memes, Doge and Pepe, to determine which one escapes the matrix and launches as a live cryptocurrency. Investors choose your side by purchasing tokens for either team (which raises $1M first wins), and the team with the most funds raised wins.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How does the presale work?",
    answer: `
      <ul className="pl-8 text-white list-disc">
        <li>Choose your champion: Team Doge (DODE) or Team Pepe (PEPE).</li>
        <li>Buy tokens to support your chosen team(s). When the combined presale total hits $1 million, the team with the most funds raised is declared the winner.</li>
      </ul>
    `,
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to the losing team’s funds?",
    answer:
      "The losing team’s funds are added to the winning token’s liquidity pool, increasing its value and ensuring a strong launch. If your team loses, you’ll still get the same amount in the winning coin but won’t receive prize money.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many times can i buy?",
    answer:
      "You can buy as many times as you like, but the total purchase is capped at $25,000 to ensure fair participation and prevent whales from dominating the presale and holding too much of the total supply.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I buy into both teams?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can support both Doge and Pepe by purchasing tokens for both teams. However, only one will win, so choose wisely!",
  },

  {
    question: "Is the presale fair and secure?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Both presale contracts are public and fully transparent, so you can see how funds are being allocated.",
  },
  {
    question: "When does the winning token launch?",
    answer: `
   The launch date for the winning token will be announced within 24 hours of reaching the $1M target and determining the winner. The winning token will be launched on the Solana blockchain and available on Raydium. We recommend using a Phantom Wallet.
