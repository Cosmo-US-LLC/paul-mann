                The lakes are shrinking. The rivers are disappearing. Crops are
                withering in fields, and drinking water is becoming toxic. This
                isn't the distant futureâ€”it's happening now.

                With water demand set to exceed supply by 40% by 2030, we are
                heading toward an era of mass starvation, disease, and violent
                conflict. If we do nothing, entire regions will turn to dust. The
                time for action is now.
